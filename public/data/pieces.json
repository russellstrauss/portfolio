I thought of what the song might mean, what it tries to communicate, and what that might look like on a screen. I tried to listen more closely to the music and really focus on what images the music builds in my mind. When shooting the video, I tried to elaborate on some of the themes that the music touches on such as: the smallness or insignificance of human beings, the aesthetics of lights, the stars and the moon, the busyness of our lives and how small and insignificant we are, and the overall awesomeness and grandeur of the Universe. I shot within the city and let the bigness of the city parallel and serve as a metaphor with the theme of the hugeness of the Universe.</p><p>Since I was not able to get any shots of the night sky in detail with the primitive equipment that I have, I let the city lights serve as a substitute. I made sure that the rhythm of the video matches the rhythm of the music, such as only cutting on beat with the music or the stop motion segments alongside the fleeting sounds of the flute and keyboard. Segments with quicker tempoed sounds match with quicker movements on the screen, and more peaceful music match with serene landscapes or sights of lights. I tried to focus on the framing and color of the shots in the video the most. With all of the city lights, the colors are very important. Additionally, the camera movement provided another hugely important element in the video, which offers different artistic perspectives in the way the images are presented.</p>",

The cosine and sine squares move up and left in the matrix as we cancel out each element in the column. So for example, when we try to cancel out the bottom left element of the Hilbert matrix will start in the bottom right corner and as we move upward through the Hilbert matrix columns, the cosine and sine square in the rotation matrix will move up one row and left one column as we proceed. The rest of the elements are filled with the identity. It follows the form:</p><img class=\"add-border center margin-bottom-small\" alt=\"rotation-matrix\" src=\"/img/math//rotation-matrix.jpg\" /><p>The values of cosine and sine are calculated with:</p><img class=\"add-border center margin-bottom-small\" alt=\"sin-cos\" src=\"/img/math//sin-cos.jpg\" /><p>where b is the element in the Hilbert matrix that we are trying to cancel out, and a is the element above it.

To calculate X, we used the equation Q<sup>t</sup>b=y to solve for y, and then used back substitution in RX=y to solve for X. The larger error in maxNorm(HX-b) is because we used Python to solve for Hx-b which can not handle such large numbers as Java can.
