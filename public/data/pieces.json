I thought of what the song might mean, what it tries to communicate, and what that might look like on a screen. I tried to listen more closely to the music and really focus on what images the music builds in my mind. When shooting the video, I tried to elaborate on some of the themes that the music touches on such as: the smallness or insignificance of human beings, the aesthetics of lights, the stars and the moon, the busyness of our lives and how small and insignificant we are, and the overall awesomeness and grandeur of the Universe. I shot within the city and let the bigness of the city parallel and serve as a metaphor with the theme of the hugeness of the Universe.</p><p>Since I was not able to get any shots of the night sky in detail with the primitive equipment that I have, I let the city lights serve as a substitute. I made sure that the rhythm of the video matches the rhythm of the music, such as only cutting on beat with the music or the stop motion segments alongside the fleeting sounds of the flute and keyboard. Segments with quicker tempoed sounds match with quicker movements on the screen, and more peaceful music match with serene landscapes or sights of lights. I tried to focus on the framing and color of the shots in the video the most. With all of the city lights, the colors are very important. Additionally, the camera movement provided another hugely important element in the video, which offers different artistic perspectives in the way the images are presented.</p>",

The user is prompted to enter a dimension, and the program generates the Hilbert matrix (and each successive step in the process) based upon that dimension.</p>",

Next we need an identity matrix to work with, so we create it with two for loops and create a temporary matrix, tempL, and set it to the identity. Next, we use the tempL by dividing the elements in the Hilbert matrix (locally called “Matrix”) and multiply it by our variable L matrix to find the end product L matrix.</p><p>In other words, to find L, we want to find the inverse of the Hilbert matrix--what matrix when multiplied by the original matrix will equal the identity matrix.

To calculate X, we used the equation Lb=y to solve for y, and then used back substitution in UX=y to solve for X.
